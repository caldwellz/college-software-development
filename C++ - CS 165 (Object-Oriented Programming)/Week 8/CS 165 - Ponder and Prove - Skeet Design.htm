            <h1>08 Prove : Design - Skeet</h1>


            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Your assignment is to design the classes you will need for your Skeet project and the relationships among them.</p>
            <p>Refer to the <a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/2315e65e-a34a-48d3-814d-4175a2b74ed5/1/prove/165-project-skeet.html">Skeet project description</a> for the details of this project.</p>



            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Prepare UML class diagrams of all the classes that you 
will have in your program. Make sure to include all of the member 
variables, constructors, and methods you will need. Also make sure to 
indicate any IS-A or HAS-A relationships.</p>

            <p>Please prepare this electronically and print it out.</p>

            <p>The classes will have to exhibit the highest level of 
encapsulation design. They should be designed for reuse later in the 
semester.</p>

            <p>For this assignment, you do not need to create a complete
 design document with all of its sections. Instead just prepare a class 
diagram for the classes you will use.</p>

            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>Face to face students should bring a printed copy of 
their UML diagrams to class. Online students should submit their 
documents as PDF files in I-Learn.</p>
